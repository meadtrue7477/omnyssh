## 1.0.0 — 2026-04-18

First production-ready release of OmnySSH.

### Features

#### Dashboard
- Server cards with live **CPU / RAM / Disk** metrics, uptime, and load average
- Colour-coded thresholds: 🟢 < 60%, 🟡 60–85%, 🔴 > 85%
- Async metrics collection — each host polled independently via SSH
- Cross-platform parsers: Linux (`top`/`free`/`/proc/stat`), macOS (`vm_stat`), Alpine BusyBox
- Configurable poll interval (default 30 s) with exponential backoff on failure
- Sort by name / CPU / RAM / status (`s`)
- Filter by tag (`t`)
- Manual refresh (`r`)
- Connection status indicator: `●` online, `◐` connecting, `✗` failed
- Connection pool: one SSH connection per host, reused for all metrics

#### Host management
- Host list with instant fuzzy search (`/`)
- Automatic import from `~/.ssh/config` (Host, HostName, User, Port, IdentityFile, ProxyJump, Include)
- Add / Edit / Delete hosts via TUI forms
- Tags and notes for each host
- Persistence in `~/.config/omnyssh/hosts.toml` — original `~/.ssh/config` is never modified
- Delete confirmation popup

#### File Manager (SFTP)
- Split-panel browser: local files ↔ remote SFTP
- Directory navigation with `h/j/k/l` and arrow keys
- File operations: upload, download, delete, mkdir, rename
- Progress bar with percentage for transfers
- Multiple file selection with `Space`
- Copy (`c`) / Paste (`p`) across panels
- Plain-text file preview
- Host-picker popup for remote panel

#### Snippets
- Save, edit, and delete global and host-scoped command snippets
- Parameterised snippets with `{{placeholder}}` syntax
- Quick-execute (`x`): run ad-hoc commands from the Dashboard
- Broadcast mode (`b`): execute on multiple hosts in parallel
- Fuzzy search on the Snippets screen
- Persistence in `~/.config/omnyssh/snippets.toml`

#### Multi-session terminal
- PTY-backed terminal with tabs (`Ctrl+T` / `Ctrl+W`)
- Split-view: `Ctrl+\` vertical, `Ctrl+-` horizontal
- Tab navigation with `Ctrl+Right` / `Ctrl+Left`
- Activity indicator on tabs with unseen output
- Full VT100 terminal emulation (`portable-pty` + `vt100`)
- Non-blocking render — terminal never freezes the UI

#### Themes & Configuration
- 4 built-in colour themes: `default`, `dracula`, `nord`, `gruvbox`
- `--theme <THEME>` CLI flag to override theme at runtime: `omny --theme dracula`
- Fully configurable keybindings via `[keybindings]` in config
- `--config <FILE>` flag to load a custom config
- `--help` / `--version` flags

#### General
- Cross-platform: Linux, macOS, Windows (single static binary)
- Panic hook that restores the terminal before printing backtrace
- `russh`-based async SSH client (no external `ssh` binary dependency for metrics)
- CI: GitHub Actions matrix for Ubuntu, macOS, Windows
